## General

#### Hey, I'm John. I am a software engineer who's been lucky enough to experience a traditional education system at UCLA and fortunate enough to explore innovative and disruptive education systems at 42 Silicon Valley and App Academy. These experiences have led me to be extremely passionate about learning tech and figuring out the best ways to deliver amazing content to users. Over the past 2 years, I’ve honed my skills as a software engineer. I've built fully function backend programs in C and multiple full-stack applications in Rails, Ruby, Javascript, MERN. I'm at the stage of my software development career where I am confident and excited to contribute my software engineering skills. I would love that place to be Microsoft. 

## Skills
* JavaScript, React, Redux, HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, C,  Mongoose, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, SQL, SQLite3, PostgreSQL, Webpack, jQuery, Git, Heroku

## Projects

### Striva - Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Jquery, AJAX PostgreSQL, MapBox API      
###### [Live Link](https://striva2.herokuapp.com/) | [Github](https://github.com/jlamb916/Striva)
An activity tracker app based off Strava utilizing MapBox API for live GPS map rendering and user generated route creation.
* Leveraged Mapbox’s static image generation API by parsing and reconstructing JSON map data to retrieve static routes images directly rather than storing images in the database, thereby reducing data storage load
* Implemented Flux Architecture using Redux to manage application state and constructed a normalized state shape pattern to delegate render responsibility directly to key components, optimizing UI performance by mitigating the need for reflow. 
* Harnessed React to build out Single-Page-Application by isolating components based on separation of concerns, allowing for efficient rendering of components.

### Mastery - JavaScript, Node.js, React, Redux, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js     	
###### [Live Link](https://masteryapp.herokuapp.com/) | [Github](https://github.com/codedbyq/Mastery)
An app to track and measure your skills, create and view associated tasks, with time tracking and social media features. 
* Employed Mongoose API to to model and manipulate MongoDB data for backend features tasks and followers. Added additional validation constraints using Validator library to ensure valid database entries.
* Seamlessly integrated tasks feature into an already existing react framework by adding a tasks slice of state through redux, axios requests to fetch backend tasks data, and lightweight React components to display, edit, and create new tasks.
* Spun up a web server framework using Express.js for quick deployment and built RESTful routes to handle requests for users, followers, tasks.

### Jumper - Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas
###### [Live Link](https://jlamb916.github.io/jumpman/) | [Github](https://github.com/jlamb916/jumpman)
A vertical platform game inspired by Doodle Jump.
* Utilized OOP principles to encapsulate game states and modularize classes to maintain clean and concise code.
* Rendered frames using pure HTML canvas to animate objects by using a requestAnimateFrame loop which makes asynchronous calls to a game loop and renders the map at a high resolution frame rate.
* Applied native JavaScript manipulation tools by attaching event listeners to keep track of objects movement and enables the user to start the game with a press of a button.
