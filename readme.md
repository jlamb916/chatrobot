## Projects

### Striva - Ruby on Rails, React, Redux, Jquery, AJAX PostgreSQL, MapBox API      
#### An activity tracker app based off Strava utilizing MapBox API for live GPS map rendering and user generated route creation.
* Leveraged Mapboxâ€™s static image generation API by parsing and reconstructing JSON map data to retrieve static routes images directly rather than storing images in the database, thereby reducing data storage load
* Implemented Flux Architecture using Redux to manage application state and constructed a normalized state shape pattern to delegate render responsibility directly to key components, optimizing UI performance by mitigating the need for reflow. 
* Harnessed React to build out Single-Page-Application by isolating components based on separation of concerns, allowing for efficient rendering of components.

### Mastery - JavaScript, Node.js, React, Redux, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express.js     	
#### An app to track and measure your skills, create and view associated tasks, with time tracking and social media features. 
* Employed Mongoose API to to model and manipulate MongoDB data for backend features tasks and followers. Added additional validation constraints using Validator library to ensure valid database entries.
* Seamlessly integrated tasks feature into an already existing react framework by adding a tasks slice of state through redux, axios requests to fetch backend tasks data, and lightweight React components to display, edit, and create new tasks.
* Spun up a web server framework using Express.js for quick deployment and built RESTful routes to handle requests for users, followers, tasks.

### Jumper - Vanilla JavaScript and HTML5 Canvas                           					                Live Site | Github
#### A vertical platform game inspired by Doodle Jump.
* Utilized OOP principles to encapsulate game states and modularize classes to maintain clean and concise code.
* Rendered frames using pure HTML canvas to animate objects by using a requestAnimateFrame loop which makes asynchronous calls to a game loop and renders the map at a high resolution frame rate.
* Applied native JavaScript manipulation tools by attaching event listeners to keep track of objects movement and enables the user to start the game with a press of a button.
